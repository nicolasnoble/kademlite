"""Tests for v0.3.0 per-CPL bucket-fill bootstrap.

The original Kademlia paper (Maymounkov & Mazieres 2002) defines the
join procedure as: insert known node, lookup own ID, then refresh all
k-buckets farther than the closest-neighbor bucket. rust-libp2p does
this synchronously inside the bootstrap QueryId. kademlite v0.2.0 only
ran the self-lookup on bootstrap and deferred per-bucket refresh to
the 5-minute maintenance loop, so cold consumers issuing PUT/GET right
after start saw an under-populated routing table.

v0.3.0 adds:
- ``DhtNode.start(wait_until_routable=True)`` (default) runs one round
  of ``_refresh_buckets`` after the self-lookup.
- ``DhtNode.wait_until_routable()`` for callers who used
  ``start(wait_until_routable=False)`` and want to refresh later.
