"""Tests for v0.3.0 dial/accept mid-handshake cleanup and per-stream
task tracking.

The audit's round-3 deferred item: the connection-establishment paths
allocated TCP sockets, Noise state, and yamux background tasks
incrementally, but a failure in any later step (timeout, cancellation,
peer disconnect) left earlier-allocated resources dangling. Listener
closed the writer on accept failure but didn't unwind noise/yamux.
Dial callers timed out at higher layers but didn't release resources
allocated mid-handshake. Per-stream handler tasks spawned by the
dispatcher weren't tracked, so Connection.close() left them running
against a torn-down session.
